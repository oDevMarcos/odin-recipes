    <h2>How to make pork dumplings</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare dipping sauce: Combine soy sauce, rice vinegar, chives, sesame
        seeds, and chile sauce in a small bowl. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare dumplings: Mix pork, garlic, egg, chives, soy sauce, sesame oil,
        and ginger in a large bowl until thoroughly combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a dumpling wrapper on a lightly floured work surface and spoon
        about 1 tablespoon of the filling in the middle. Wet the edge with a
        little water and crimp together forming small pleats to seal the
        dumpling. Repeat to form remaining dumplings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 to 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over
        medium-high heat. Place 8 to 10 dumplings in the pan and cook until
        browned, about 2 minutes per side. Pour in 1 cup of water; cover and
        cook until the dumplings are tender and pork is cooked through, about 5
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat to cook remaining dumplings, adding more oil and water for each
        batch.
      </li>
      <li>Serve dumplings with dipping sauce.</li>
